\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:con}
We propose \qevis{}, an interactive visual analytics system for understanding distributed query execution. \qevis{} incorporates a suit of views that visualize query execution at different granularities and thus allows to analyze complex query execution problems. In particular, we (i) design a new layout algorithm to compactly display the overall execution progress of the jobs in a query and their dependencies; (ii) devise two anomaly scoring methods and corresponding visualizations to show the overall anomaly degrees of the jobs and machines; (iii) propose a scatter plot-based visual encoding to summarize the massive atomic tasks and complex data dependencies among them; and (iv) implement a suite of auxiliary views and rich interactions to support cross-view exploration.
We deploy \qevis{} in the production environment of a company and use it to analyze queries from real applications.
There are two promising future directions: (i) extending the techniques of \qevis{} to other big data systems (e.g., Spark, Flink); and (ii) designing methods to automatically identify query execution bottlenecks and generate effective solutions to resolve these bottlenecks.
